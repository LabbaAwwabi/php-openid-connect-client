PHP OpenID Connect Basic Client
========================
A simple library that allows an application to authenticate a user through the basic OpenID Connect flow.
This library hopes to encourage OpenID Connect use by making it simple enough for a developer with little knowledge of
the OpenID Connect protocol to setup authentication.

A special thanks goes to Justin Richer and Amanda Anganes for their help and support of the protocol.
